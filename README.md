run this in the command line as follows:

```python rhythm.py```

If run without arguments, 1 bar of 4/4 rhythms of 16th note subdivisions will be generated.

you can run the script with the 1st argument changing the beats to the bar. so for example:

```python rhythm.py 6```

will generate 1 bar of 6/4 rhythms.

The 2nd argument will change the subdivisions per beat. For example:

```python rhythm.py 4 6```

will generate 1 bar of 4/4 rhythms of 16th note triplet subdivision.
